Antipsychotic drugs should also be used with caution in Parkinson\u2019s disease (may be exacerbated by antipsychotics), epilepsy (and conditions predisposing to seizures), depression, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, or a susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma. Caution is also required in severe respiratory disease and in patients with a history of jaundice or who have blood dyscrasias (perform blood counts if unexplained infection or fever develops). As photosensitisation may occur with higher dosages, patients should avoid direct sunlight. Patients with schizophrenia should have physical health monitoring (including cardiovascular disease risk assessment) at least once per year. Interactions: Appendix 1 (antipsychotics).

They are easy to recognise but cannot be predicted accurately because they depend on the dose, the type of drug, and on individual susceptibility.Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of:parkinsonian symptoms (including tremor), which may occur more commonly in adults or the elderly and may appear gradually;dystonia (abnormal face and body movements) and dyskinesia, which occur more commonly in children or young adults and appear after only a few doses;akathisia (restlessness), which characteristically occurs after large initial doses and may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated;tardive dyskinesia (rhythmic, involuntary movements of tongue, face, and jaw), which usually develops on long-term therapy or with high dosage, but it may develop on short-term treatment with low doses\u2014short-lived tardive dyskinesia may occur after withdrawal of the drug.Parkinsonian symptoms remit if the drug is withdrawn and may be suppressed by the administration of antimuscarinic drugs (section 4.9.2). However, routine administration of such drugs is not justified because not all patients are affected and they may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia.Tardive dyskinesia is the most serious manifestation of extrapyramidal symptoms; it is of particular concern because it may be irreversible on withdrawing therapy and treatment is usually ineffective. However, some manufacturers suggest that drug withdrawal at the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia (fine vermicular movements of the tongue) may halt its full development. Tardive dyskinesia occurs fairly frequently, especially in the elderly, and treatment must be carefully and regularly reviewed.Most antipsychotic drugs, both first- and second-generation, increase prolactin concentration to some extent because dopamine inhibits prolactin release. Aripiprazole reduces prolactin because it is a dopamine-receptor partial agonist. Risperidone, amisulpride, and first-generation antipsychotic drugs are most likely to cause symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia. The clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia include sexual dysfunction, reduced bone mineral density, menstrual disturbances, breast enlargement, and galactorrhoea. Sexual dysfunction is one of the main causes of non-adherence to antipsychotic medication; physical illness, psychiatric illness, and substance misuse are contributing factors. Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is caused by more than one mechanism. Reduced dopamine transmission and hyperprolactinaemia decrease libido; antimuscarinic effects can cause disorders of arousal; and alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists are associated with erection and ejaculation problems in men. Risperidone and haloperidol commonly cause sexual dysfunction. If sexual dysfunction is thought to be antipsychotic-induced, dose reduction or switching medication should be considered. Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with cardiovascular side-effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias (see under Monitoring), and hypotension (see below). QT-interval prolongation is a particular concern with pimozide (see ECG monitoring in pimozide monograph) and haloperidol. There is also a higher probability of QT-interval prolongation in patients using any intravenous antipsychotic drug, or any antipsychotic drug or combination of antipsychotic drugs with doses exceeding the recommended maximum. Cases of sudden death have occurred.Hyperglycaemia and sometimes diabetes can occur with antipsychotic drugs, particularly clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. All antipsychotic drugs may cause weight gain, but the risk and extent varies. Clozapine and olanzapine commonly cause weight gain.Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation are dose-related side-effects that are liable to cause dangerous falls and hypothermia or hyperthermia in the elderly. Clozapine, chlorpromazine, and quetiapine can cause postural hypotension (especially during initial dose titration) which may be associated with syncope or reflex tachycardia in some patients.Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperthermia, fluctuating level of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, sweating, and urinary incontinence) is a rare but potentially fatal side-effect of all antipsychotic drugs. Discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug is essential because there is no proven effective treatment, but bromocriptine and dantrolene have been used. The syndrome, which usually lasts for 5\u20137 days after drug discontinuation, may be unduly prolonged if depot preparations have been used.Hypersalivation associated with clozapine therapy can be treated with hyoscine hydrobromide [unlicensed indication], provided that the patient is not at particular risk from the additive antimuscarinic side-effects of hyoscine and clozapine.Other side-effects include: drowsiness; apathy; agitation, excitement and insomnia; convulsions; dizziness; headache; confusion; gastro-intestinal disturbances; nasal congestion; antimuscarinic symptoms (such as dry mouth, constipation, difficulty with micturition, and blurred vision; very rarely, precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma); venous thromboembolism; blood dyscrasias (such as agranulocytosis and leucopenia), photosensitisation, contact sensitisation and rashes, and jaundice (including cholestatic); corneal and lens opacities, and purplish pigmentation of the skin, cornea, conjunctiva, and retina.Overdosage: for poisoning with phenothiazines and related compounds and atypical antipsychotic drugs, see Emergency Treatment of Poisoning.; also\r\nabdominal pain, dry mouth, hypersalivation, vomiting; tachycardia,\r\nbradycardia, first-degree AV block, bundle branch block; drowsiness,\r\nagitation, headache, asthenia; less commonly palpitation,\r\narrhythmias, ischaemia, oedema, seizures, nightmare, syncope, menstrual\r\ndisturbances, erectile dysfunction, galactorrhoea, gynaecomastia,\r\nand rash; cerebrovascular accident also reported", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/215619.htm", "doses": ["adult over 18 years, 6\u00a0mg\r\nonce daily in the morning, adjusted if necessary in increments of\r\n3\u00a0mg over at least 5 days; usual range 3\u201312\u00a0mg daily", "Always take with breakfast or always\r\ntake on an empty stomach"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0see Pregnancy notes; also use only if potential\r\nbenefit outweighs risk\u2014toxicity in animal studies; if discontinuation\r\nduring pregnancy is necessary, withdraw gradually"}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0schizophrenia; psychotic or manic symptoms of\r\nschizoaffective disorder", "name": "PALIPERIDONE - SECOND-GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "4 Central nervous system", "4.2 Drugs used in psychoses and related disorders", "4.2.1 Antipsychotic drugs", "Second-generation antipsychotic drugs", "PALIPERIDONE"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0\n(From 4.2.1 Antipsychotic drugs: British National Formulary)\nCautions\u00a0Antipsychotic drugs should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease; an ECG may be required (see individual drug monographs), particularly if physical examination identifies cardiovascular risk factors, if there is a personal history of cardiovascular disease, or if the patient is being admitted as an inpatient.
