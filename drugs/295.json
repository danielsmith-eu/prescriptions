When the condition improves and the sensitivity of the Bacillus anthracis strain is known, treatment may be switched to a single antibacterial. Treatment should continue for 60 days because germination may be delayed.Cutaneous anthrax should be treated with either ciprofloxacin [unlicensed indication] or doxycycline [unlicensed indication] (section 5.1.3) for 7 days. Treatment may be switched to amoxicillin (section 5.1.1.3) if the infecting strain is susceptible. Treatment may need to be extended to 60 days if exposure is due to aerosol. A combination of antibacterials for 14 days is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with systemic features, extensive oedema, or lesions of the head or neck.Ciprofloxacin or doxycycline may be given for post-exposure prophylaxis. If exposure is confirmed, antibacterial prophylaxis should continue for 60 days. Antibacterial prophylaxis may be switched to amoxicillin after 10\u201314 days if the strain of B. anthracis is susceptible.
