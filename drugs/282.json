Antimuscarinic drugs can be useful in drug-induced parkinsonism, but they are generally not used in idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease because they are less effective than dopaminergic drugs and they are associated with cognitive impairment.The antimuscarinic drugs orphenadrine, procyclidine, and trihexyphenidyl reduce the symptoms of parkinsonism induced by antipsychotic drugs, but there is no justification for giving them routinely in the absence of parkinsonian side-effects. Tardive dyskinesia is not improved by antimuscarinic drugs and may be made worse.In idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, antimuscarinic drugs reduce tremor and rigidity but they have little effect on bradykinesia. They may be useful in reducing sialorrhoea.There are no important differences between the antimuscarinic drugs, but some patients tolerate one better than another.Procyclidine can be given parenterally and is effective emergency treatment for acute drug-induced dystonic reactions.)", "name": "PROCYCLIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "4 Central nervous system", "4.9 Drugs used in parkinsonism and related disorders", "4.9.2 Antimuscarinic drugs used in parkinsonism", "PROCYCLIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0\n(From 4.9.2 Antimuscarinic drugs used in parkinsonism: British National Formulary)\nAntimuscarinics should be used with caution in cardiovascular disease, hypertension, psychotic disorders, prostatic hypertrophy, pyrexia, in those susceptible to angle-closure glaucoma, and in the elderly.
