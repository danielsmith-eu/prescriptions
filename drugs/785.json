Interactions: Appendix 1 (sympathomimetics, beta2).Hypokalaemia\u00a0Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from beta2 agonist therapy. Particular caution is required in severe asthma, because this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with theophylline and its derivatives, corticosteroids, and diuretics, and by hypoxia. Plasma-potassium concentration should therefore be monitored in severe asthma.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 3.1.1.1 Selective beta2 agonists: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Side-effects of the beta2 agonists include fine tremor (particularly in the hands), nervous tension, headache, muscle cramps, and palpitation. Other side-effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, peripheral vasodilation, myocardial ischaemia, and disturbances of sleep and behaviour. Paradoxical bronchospasm (occasionally severe), urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, and collapse have also been reported.
