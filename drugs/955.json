For interactions: see Appendix 1 (corticosteroids)MHRA/CHM advice (July 2008)Beclometasone dipropionate CFC-free pressurised metered-dose inhalers (Qvar\u00ae and Clenil Modulite\u00ae) are not interchangeable and should be prescribed by brand name; Qvar\u00ae has extra-fine particles, is more potent than traditional beclometasone dipropionate CFC-containing inhalers, and is approximately twice as potent as Clenil Modulite\u00ae;Fostair\u00ae is a combination beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate CFC-free pressurised metered-dose inhaler; Fostair\u00ae has extra-fine particles and is more potent than traditional beclometasone dipropionate CFC-free inhalers.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 3.2 Corticosteroids: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects of inhaled corticosteroids\u00a0Inhaled corticosteroids have considerably fewer systemic effects than oral corticosteroids (section 6.3.2), but adverse effects have been reported.High doses of inhaled corticosteroids (see Management of Chronic Asthma table) used for prolonged periods can induce adrenal suppression. Inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with adrenal crisis and coma in children; excessive doses should be avoided. Patients using high doses of inhaled corticosteroids should be given a \u2018steroid card\u2019 (section 6.3.2) and specific written advice to consider corticosteroid replacement during an episode of stress, such as severe intercurrent illness or an operation.High doses of inhaled corticosteroid have been associated with lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Bone mineral density may be reduced following long-term inhalation of higher doses of corticosteroids, predisposing patients to osteoporosis (section 6.6). It is therefore sensible to ensure that the dose of an inhaled corticosteroid is no higher than necessary to keep a patient\u2019s asthma under good control.In children, growth restriction associated with systemic corticosteroid therapy does not seem to occur with recommended doses of inhaled therapy; although initial growth velocity may be reduced, there appears to be no effect on achieving normal adult height. However, the height of children receiving prolonged treatment of inhaled corticosteroid should be monitored; if growth is slowed, referral to a paediatrician should be considered. Large-volume spacer devices should be used for administering inhaled corticosteroids in children under 15 years (see NICE guidance, section 3.1.5); they are also useful in older children and adults, particularly if high doses are required. Spacer devices increase airway deposition and reduce oropharyngeal deposition.A small risk of glaucoma with prolonged high doses of inhaled corticosteroids has been reported. Hoarseness, throat irritation, dysphonia, and candidiasis of the mouth or throat may occur with inhaled corticosteroids (see also below). Hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and angioedema) have been reported rarely. Paradoxical bronchospasm has been reported very rarely. Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and behavioural changes including hyperactivity, irritability, and aggression (particularly in children), hyperglycaemia, cataracts, skin thinning and bruising have also been reported.Candidiasis\u00a0The risk of oral candidiasis can be reduced by using a spacer device with the corticosteroid inhaler; rinsing the mouth with water (or cleaning a child\u2019s teeth) after inhalation of a dose may also be helpful. Antifungal oral suspension or oral gel (section 12.3.2) can be used to treat oral candidiasis without discontinuing therapy.; also less commonly nausea, taste disturbances", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/129218.htm", "doses": ["By aerosol inhalation, 160\u00a0micrograms daily\r\nas a single dose reduced to 80\u00a0micrograms daily if control maintained;\r\ndose may be increased to max. 320\u00a0micrograms twice daily if necessary\r\nin severe asthma [unlicensed]; child 12\u201318 years, 160\u00a0micrograms daily as a single dose reduced to 80\u00a0micrograms\r\ndaily if control maintained"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0see section 3.1"}]
