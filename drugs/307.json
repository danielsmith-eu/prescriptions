However, many organisms are now resistant to macrolides or rapidly develop resistance; their use should therefore be limited to short courses. Metronidazole (section 5.1.11) may be preferred as an alternative to a penicillin.Cautions\u00a0Macrolides should be used with caution in patients with a predisposition to QT interval prolongation (including electrolyte disturbances and concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval). Macrolides may aggravate myasthenia gravis. ; neonate under\r\n2 weeks (risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis); avoid in acute porphyria (%s\n(From 9.8.2 Acute porphyrias: British National Formulary)\n9.8.2 Acute porphyrias); interactions: Appendix 1\r\n(macrolides)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 5.1.5 Macrolides: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhoea are the most common side-effects of the macrolides, but they are mild and less frequent with azithromycin and clarithromycin than with erythromycin. Hepatotoxicity (including cholestatic jaundice) and rash occur less frequently. Other side-effects reported rarely or very rarely include pancreatitis, antibiotic-associated colitis, QT interval prolongation, arrhythmias, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Generally reversible hearing loss (sometimes with tinnitus) has been reported after large doses of a macrolide; it occurs commonly after long-term therapy with azithromycin.
