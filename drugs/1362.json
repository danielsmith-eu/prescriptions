Toxic effects after administration of local anaesthetics are a result of excessively high plasma concentrations; severe toxicity usually results from inadvertent intravascular injection or too rapid injection.The systemic toxicity of local anaesthetics mainly involves the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. CNS effects include a feeling of inebriation and lightheadedness followed by drowsiness, numbness of the tongue and perioral region, restlessness, paraesthesia (including sensations of hot and cold), dizziness, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, muscle twitching, tremors, and convulsions. Transient excitation may also occur, followed by depression with drowsiness, respiratory failure, unconsciousness, and coma. Effects on the cardiovascular system include myocardial depression and peripheral vasodilatation resulting in hypotension and bradycardia; arrhythmias and cardiac arrest can occur.Hypersensitivity reactions occur mainly with the ester-type local anaesthetics, such as tetracaine; reactions are less frequent with the amide types, such as articaine, bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, and ropivacaine.
