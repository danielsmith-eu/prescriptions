It has more influence on vessels and less on the myocardium than does verapamil, and unlike verapamil has no anti-arrhythmic activity. It rarely precipitates heart failure because any negative inotropic effect is offset by a reduction in left ventricular work. Short-acting formulations of nifedipine are not recommended for angina or long-term management of hypertension; their use may be associated with large variations in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia. Nicardipine has similar effects to those of nifedipine and may produce less reduction of myocardial contractility. Amlodipine and felodipine also resemble nifedipine and nicardipine in their effects and do not reduce myocardial contractility and they do not produce clinical deterioration in heart failure. They have a longer duration of action and can be given once daily. Nifedipine, nicardipine, amlodipine, and felodipine are used for the treatment of angina (section 2.10.1) or hypertension. All are valuable in forms of angina associated with coronary vasospasm. Side-effects associated with vasodilatation such as flushing and headache (which become less obtrusive after a few days), and ankle swelling (which may respond only partially to diuretics) are common. ; also withdraw if ischaemic pain\r\noccurs or existing pain worsens shortly after initiating treatment; poor cardiac reserve; heart failure or significantly impaired left ventricular function\r\n(heart failure deterioration observed); severe hypotension; elderly; diabetes mellitus; acute\r\nporphyria (but \n(From 9.8.2 Acute porphyrias: British National Formulary)\n9.8.2 Acute porphyrias); interactions: Appendix 1\r\n(calcium-channel blockers)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0gastro-intestinal disturbance; hypotension, oedema,\r\nvasodilatation, palpitation; headache, dizziness, lethargy, asthenia; less commonly tachycardia, syncope, chills, nasal congestion,\r\ndyspnoea, anxiety, sleep disturbance, vertigo, migraine, paraesthesia,\r\ntremor, polyuria, dysuria, nocturia, erectile dysfunction, epistaxis,\r\nmyalgia, joint swelling, visual disturbance, sweating, hypersensitivity\r\nreactions (including angioedema, jaundice, pruritus, urticaria, and\r\nrash); rarely anorexia, gum hyperplasia, mood disturbances,\r\nhyperglycaemia, male infertility, purpura, and photosensitivity reactions;\r\nalso reported dysphagia, intestinal obstruction, intestinal ulcer,\r\nbezoar formation (with some modified-release preparations), gynaecomastia,\r\nagranulocytosis, and anaphylaxis; overdosage, see Emergency Treatment of Poisoning", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/106042.htm", "doses": ["See preparations below", "angina prophylaxis (but not recommended, see notes above)\r\nand Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, initially 5\u00a0mg 3 times daily, adjusted according\r\nto response to 20\u00a0mg 3 times daily"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0may inhibit labour; manufacturer advises avoid before\r\nweek 20; risk to fetus should be balanced against risk of uncontrolled\r\nmaternal hypertension; use only if other treatment options are not\r\nindicated or have failed"}]
