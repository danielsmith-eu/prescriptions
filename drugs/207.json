Clinical trials have failed to show efficacy and have shown an increase in harmful outcomes. However, it is recognised that specialists may sometimes decide to use these drugs in response to individual clinical need; children and adolescents should be monitored carefully for suicidal behaviour, self-harm or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment.Only fluoxetine has been shown in clinical trials to be effective for treating depressive illness in children and adolescents. However, it is possible that, in common with the other SSRIs, it is associated with a small risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Overall, the balance of risks and benefits for fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive illness in individuals under 18 years is considered favourable, but children and adolescents must be carefully monitored as above.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 4.3.3 Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0SSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants (section 4.3.1). Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastro-intestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common\u2014include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash (consider discontinuation\u2014may be sign of impending serious systemic reaction, possibly associated with vasculitis), urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions (see Cautions above), galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania (see Cautions above), movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances, hyponatraemia (see Hyponatraemia and Antidepressant Therapy), and bleeding disorders including ecchymoses and purpura. Suicidal behaviour has been linked with antidepressants (see Suicidal Behaviour and Antidepressant Therapy). Angle-closure glaucoma may very rarely be precipitated by treatment with SSRIs.Overdosage: for advice on overdosage with SSRIs see Emergency Treatment of Poisoning; palpitation, tachycardia, malaise; less commonly postural hypotension, confusion, ataxia; rarely abnormal liver function, usually symptomatic (discontinue\r\ntreatment); also reported paraesthesia, taste disturbance,\r\nneuroleptic malignant syndrome-like event", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/3367.htm", "doses": ["Depression, adult over\r\n18 years, initially 50\u2013100\u00a0mg daily in the evening, increased gradually\r\nif necessary to max. 300\u00a0mg daily (over 150\u00a0mg in divided doses);\r\nusual maintenance dose 100\u00a0mg daily", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder, initially 50\u00a0mg in the evening\r\nincreased gradually if necessary after some weeks to max. 300\u00a0mg daily\r\n(over 150\u00a0mg in divided doses); usual maintenance dose 100\u2013300\u00a0mg\r\ndaily; child over 8 years initially\r\n25\u00a0mg daily increased if necessary in steps of 25\u00a0mg every 4\u20137 days\r\nto max. 200\u00a0mg daily (over 50\u00a0mg in 2 divided doses)", "If no improvement in obsessive-compulsive\r\ndisorder within 10 weeks, treatment should be reconsidered"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0\n(From 4.3.3 Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors: British National Formulary)\nPregnancy\u00a0Manufacturers advise that SSRIs should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk. There is a small increased risk of congenital heart defects when SSRIs are taken during early pregnancy. If SSRIs are used during the third trimester there is a risk of neonatal withdrawal symptoms, and persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn has been reported; see also individual monographs."}]
