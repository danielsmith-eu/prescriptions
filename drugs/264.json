It may be tried for atypical absence, atonic, and tonic seizures. Rebound seizures may be a problem on withdrawal; elderly; debilitated; children; respiratory depression (avoid if severe); avoid abrupt withdrawal (dependence\r\nwith prolonged use); history of drug or alcohol abuse; consider vitamin D supplementation in patients who are immobilised\r\nfor long periods or who have inadequate sun exposure or dietary intake\r\nof calcium; avoid in acute porphyria (%s\n(From Unsafe Drug Groups (check first): British National Formulary)\nUnsafe Drug Groups (check first)); interactions: \n(From 4.8.1 Control of the epilepsies: British National Formulary)\nInteractions\u00a0Interactions between antiepileptics are complex and may increase toxicity without a corresponding increase in antiepileptic effect. Interactions are usually caused by hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition; displacement from protein binding sites is not usually a problem. These interactions are highly variable and unpredictable.For interactions of antiepileptic drugs, see Appendix 1; for advice on hormonal contraception and enzyme-inducing drugs, see section 7.3.1 and section 7.3.2.Significant interactions that occur between antiepileptics and that may affect dosing requirements are as follows:Note\u00a0Check under each drug for possible interactions when two or more antiepileptic drugs are usedCarbamazepineoften lowers plasma concentration of clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin (but may also raise plasma-phenytoin concentration), tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepinesometimes lowers plasma concentration of eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, primidone (but tendency for corresponding increase in phenobarbital level), retigabine, and rufinamidesometimes raises plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbitalEslicarbazepineoften raises plasma concentration of phenytoinEthosuximidesometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoin Lamotriginesometimes raises plasma concentration of an active metabolite of carbamazepine (but evidence is conflicting)Oxcarbazepine sometimes lowers plasma concentration of carbamazepine (but may raise plasma concentration of an active metabolite of carbamazepine)sometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoin often raises plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbitalPhenobarbital or primidoneoften lowers plasma concentration of clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin (but may also raise plasma-phenytoin concentration), tiagabine, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepinesometimes lowers plasma concentration of ethosuximide, rufinamide, and topiramatePhenytoin often lowers plasma concentration of clonazepam, carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepineoften raises plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbitalsometimes lowers plasma concentration of ethosuximide, primidone (by increasing conversion to phenobarbital), retigabine, and rufinamideRufinamidesometimes lowers plasma concentration of carbamazepinesometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoinTopiramate sometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoinValproatesometimes lowers plasma concentration of an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine often raises plasma concentration of lamotrigine, phenobarbital, primidone-derived phenobarbital, phenytoin (but may also lower), and an active metabolite of carbamazepinesometimes raises plasma concentration of ethosuximide and rufinamideVigabatrin often lowers plasma concentration of phenytoin  in section 4.8.1 and Appendix 1 (phenobarbital)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0hepatitis, cholestasis; hypotension; respiratory\r\ndepression; behavioural disturbances, nystagmus, irritability, drowsiness,\r\nlethargy, depression, ataxia, paradoxical excitement, hallucinations,\r\nimpaired memory and cognition, hyperactivity particularly in the elderly\r\nand in children; osteomalacia (see Cautions); megaloblastic anaemia\r\n(may be treated with folic acid), agranulocytosis,\r\nthrombocytopenia; allergic skin reactions; very rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis; suicidal\r\nideation; Antiepileptic Hypersensitivity\r\nSyndrome; overdosage: see Emergency Treatment of Poisoning", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/129418.htm", "doses": ["By mouth, 60\u2013180\u00a0mg at night; child 5\u20138\u00a0mg/kg daily"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0see Pregnancy"}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0status epilepticus; other forms of\r\nepilepsy except absence seizures (section 4.8.1)", "name": "PHENOBARBITAL SODIUM", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "4 Central nervous system", "4.8 Antiepileptic drugs", "4.8.2 Drugs used in status epilepticus", "PHENOBARBITAL SODIUM"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0see Phenobarbital, section 4.8.1; interactions: see Interactions in section\r\n4.8.1 and Appendix 1 (phenobarbital) ", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0see Phenobarbital, section 4.8.1", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/129417.htm", "doses": ["Status epilepticus, by intravenous injection (dilute injection 1 in 10 with water for injections), 10\u00a0mg/kg at\r\na rate of not more than 100\u00a0mg/minute; max. 1\u00a0g", "For therapeutic purposes phenobarbital and\r\nphenobarbital sodium may be considered equivalent in effect"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0see Pregnancy"}]
