Caution may be required in epilepsy. Children and the elderly are more susceptible to side-effects. Many antihistamines should be avoided in acute porphyria but some are thought to be safe, see section 9.8.2.

Drowsiness may diminish after a few days of treatment and is considerably less of a problem with the newer antihistamines (see also notes above). Side-effects that are more common with the older antihistamines include headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastro-intestinal disturbances.Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.; also\r\nexfoliative dermatitis and tinnitus reported; injections may cause\r\ntransient hypotension or CNS stimulation and may be irritant", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/3037.htm", "doses": ["By mouth, 4\u00a0mg every 4\u20136 hours, max. 24\u00a0mg\r\ndaily (elderly max. 12\u00a0mg daily); child under 1 year see BNF for Children; 1\u20132 years\r\n1\u00a0mg twice daily; 2\u20136 years 1\u00a0mg every 4\u20136 hours, max. 6\u00a0mg daily;\r\n6\u201312 years 2\u00a0mg every 4\u20136 hours, max. 12\u00a0mg daily", "By intramuscular injection or by intravenous injection over 1 minute, 10\u00a0mg, repeated\r\nif required up to max. 4 doses in 24 hours; child under 6 months 250\u00a0micrograms/kg (max. 2.5\u00a0mg); 6 months\u20136 years\r\n2.5\u00a0mg; 6\u201312 years 5\u00a0mg; these doses may be repeated if required up\r\nto max. 4 doses in 24 hours"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0\n(From 3.4.1 Antihistamines: British National Formulary)\nPregnancy\u00a0Most manufacturers of antihistamines advise avoiding their use during pregnancy; however, there is no evidence of teratogenicity except for hydroxyzine where toxicity has been reported with high doses in animal studies. The use of sedating antihistamines in the latter part of the third trimester may cause adverse effects in neonates such as irritability, paradoxical excitability, and tremor."}]
