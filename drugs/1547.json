They should also be used with caution in external chest compression, elderly, hypertension, conditions in which thrombolysis might give rise to embolic complications such as enlarged left atrium with atrial fibrillation (risk of dissolution of clot and subsequent embolisation), and recent or concurrent use of drugs that increase the risk of bleeding.; in acute stroke, monitor for intracranial haemorrhage, monitor blood pressure (antihypertensive recommended if systolic\r\nabove 180\u00a0mmHg or diastolic above 105\u00a0mmHg)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 2.10.2 Fibrinolytic drugs: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Side-effects of thrombolytics are mainly nausea and vomiting and bleeding. When thrombolytics are used in myocardial infarction, reperfusion arrhythmias and recurrent ischaemia and angina may occur. Reperfusion may also cause cerebral and pulmonary oedema. Hypotension can also occur and can usually be controlled by elevating the patient\u2019s legs, or by reducing the rate of infusion or stopping it temporarily. Back pain, fever, and convulsions have been reported. Bleeding is usually limited to the site of injection, but intracerebral haemorrhage or bleeding from other sites can occur. Serious bleeding calls for discontinuation of the thrombolytic and may require administration of coagulation factors and antifibrinolytic drugs (e.g. tranexamic acid). Rarely further embolism may occur (either due to clots that break away from the original thrombus or to cholesterol crystal emboli). Thrombolytics can cause allergic reactions (including rash, flushing and uveitis) and anaphylaxis has been reported (for details of management see Allergic Emergencies, section 3.4.3). Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been reported rarely after streptokinase treatment.; also\r\nrisk of cerebral bleeding increased in acute stroke", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/2815.htm", "doses": ["See under preparations below", "myocardial infarction, accelerated regimen (initiated\r\nwithin 6 hours of symptom onset), 15\u00a0mg by intravenous injection, followed by intravenous infusion of 50\u00a0mg over 30\r\nminutes, then 35\u00a0mg over 60 minutes (total dose 100\u00a0mg over 90 minutes);\r\nin patients less than 65\u00a0kg, 15\u00a0mg by intravenous injection, followed by intravenous infusion of 0.75\u00a0mg/kg over\r\n30 minutes, then 0.5\u00a0mg/kg over 60 minutes (max. total dose 100\u00a0mg\r\nover 90 minutes)", "Myocardial infarction, initiated within 6\u201312 hours\r\nof symptom onset, 10\u00a0mg by intravenous injection, followed by intravenous infusion of 50\u00a0mg over 60 minutes, then 4 infusions each of 10\u00a0mg over 30 minutes (total dose 100\u00a0mg\r\nover 3 hours; max. 1.5\u00a0mg/kg in patients less than 65\u00a0kg)", "Pulmonary embolism, 10\u00a0mg by intravenous injection over 1\u20132 minutes, followed by intravenous infusion of 90\u00a0mg over 2 hours; max. 1.5\u00a0mg/kg in patients less than 65\u00a0kg", "Acute stroke (treatment must begin within 3\r\nhours of symptom onset), by intravenous administration over 60 minutes, 900\u00a0micrograms/kg (max. 90\u00a0mg); initial 10% of\r\ndose by intravenous injection, remainder by intravenous infusion; elderly over 80 years not recommended"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0\n(From 2.10.2 Fibrinolytic drugs: British National Formulary)\nPregnancy\u00a0Thrombolytic drugs can possibly lead to premature separation of the placenta in the first 18 weeks of pregnancy.
