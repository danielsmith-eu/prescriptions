For interactions: see Appendix 1 (corticosteroids)MHRA/CHM advice (July 2008)Beclometasone dipropionate CFC-free pressurised metered-dose inhalers (Qvar\u00ae and Clenil Modulite\u00ae) are not interchangeable and should be prescribed by brand name; Qvar\u00ae has extra-fine particles, is more potent than traditional beclometasone dipropionate CFC-containing inhalers, and is approximately twice as potent as Clenil Modulite\u00ae;Fostair\u00ae is a combination beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate CFC-free pressurised metered-dose inhaler; Fostair\u00ae has extra-fine particles and is more potent than traditional beclometasone dipropionate CFC-free inhalers.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 3.2 Corticosteroids: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects of inhaled corticosteroids\u00a0Inhaled corticosteroids have considerably fewer systemic effects than oral corticosteroids (section 6.3.2), but adverse effects have been reported.High doses of inhaled corticosteroids (see Management of Chronic Asthma table) used for prolonged periods can induce adrenal suppression. Inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with adrenal crisis and coma in children; excessive doses should be avoided. Patients using high doses of inhaled corticosteroids should be given a \u2018steroid card\u2019 (section 6.3.2) and specific written advice to consider corticosteroid replacement during an episode of stress, such as severe intercurrent illness or an operation.High doses of inhaled corticosteroid have been associated with lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Bone mineral density may be reduced following long-term inhalation of higher doses of corticosteroids, predisposing patients to osteoporosis (section 6.6). It is therefore sensible to ensure that the dose of an inhaled corticosteroid is no higher than necessary to keep a patient\u2019s asthma under good control.In children, growth restriction associated with systemic corticosteroid therapy does not seem to occur with recommended doses of inhaled therapy; although initial growth velocity may be reduced, there appears to be no effect on achieving normal adult height. However, the height of children receiving prolonged treatment of inhaled corticosteroid should be monitored; if growth is slowed, referral to a paediatrician should be considered. Large-volume spacer devices should be used for administering inhaled corticosteroids in children under 15 years (see NICE guidance, section 3.1.5); they are also useful in older children and adults, particularly if high doses are required. Spacer devices increase airway deposition and reduce oropharyngeal deposition.A small risk of glaucoma with prolonged high doses of inhaled corticosteroids has been reported. Hoarseness, throat irritation, dysphonia, and candidiasis of the mouth or throat may occur with inhaled corticosteroids (see also below). Hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and angioedema) have been reported rarely. Paradoxical bronchospasm has been reported very rarely. Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and behavioural changes including hyperactivity, irritability, and aggression (particularly in children), hyperglycaemia, cataracts, skin thinning and bruising have also been reported.Candidiasis\u00a0The risk of oral candidiasis can be reduced by using a spacer device with the corticosteroid inhaler; rinsing the mouth with water (or cleaning a child\u2019s teeth) after inhalation of a dose may also be helpful. Antifungal oral suspension or oral gel (section 12.3.2) can be used to treat oral candidiasis without discontinuing therapy.", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/129490.htm", "doses": ["See preparations below", "by inhalation of powder, adult and child over\r\n12 years, 200\u2013800\u00a0micrograms twice daily, adjusted as necessary; alternatively,\r\nin mild to moderate asthma, for patients previously stabilised on\r\na twice daily dose, 200\u2013400\u00a0micrograms (max. 800\u00a0micrograms) as a\r\nsingle dose in the evening; child 6\u201312\r\nyears 200\u2013400\u00a0micrograms twice daily, adjusted as necessary; alternatively,\r\nin mild to moderate asthma, for patients previously stabilised on\r\na twice daily dose, 200\u2013400\u00a0micrograms as a single dose in the evening"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0see section 3.1"}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0see preparations", "name": "BUDESONIDE - CHRONIC BOWEL DISORDERS", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "1 Gastro-intestinal system", "1.5 Chronic bowel disorders", "1.5.2 Corticosteroids", "BUDESONIDE"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0section 6.3.2; for autoimmune hepatitis, monitor liver function tests every 2 weeks\r\nfor 1 month, then at least every 3 months; interactions: Appendix 1 (corticosteroids)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0section 6.3.2", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/76834.htm", "doses": ["See preparations", "mild to moderate Crohn\u2019s disease affecting ileum or ascending\r\ncolon, chronic diarrhoea due to collagenous colitis, adult over 18 years, 3\u00a0mg 3 times daily for up to\r\n8 weeks; reduce dose for the last 2 weeks of treatment (see also section 6.3.2); child 12\u201318\r\nyears see BNF for Children", "Autoimmune hepatitis, adult over\r\n18 years, induction of remission, 3\u00a0mg 3 times daily; maintenance,\r\n3\u00a0mg twice daily", "ulcerative colitis affecting sigmoid colon and rectum, by rectum, adult over 18 years,\r\n1 metered application (budesonide 2\u00a0mg) once daily for up to 8 weeks"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0section 6.3.2"}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0prophylaxis and treatment of allergic\r\nand vasomotor rhinitis; nasal polyps", "name": "BUDESONIDE - DRUGS USED IN NASAL ALLERGY", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "12 Ear, nose, and oropharynx", "12.2 Drugs acting on the nose", "12.2.1 Drugs used in nasal allergy", "Corticosteroids"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0\n(From Corticosteroids: British National Formulary)\nCautions\u00a0Corticosteroid nasal preparations should be avoided in the presence of untreated nasal infections, and also after nasal surgery (until healing has occurred); they should also be avoided in pulmonary tuberculosis.
