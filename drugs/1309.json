Patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome include those with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (especially if high grade and bulky disease), Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia (particularly if high white blood cell counts or bulky disease), and occasionally those with solid tumours. Pre-existing hyperuricaemia, dehydration, and renal impairment are also predisposing factors. Features include hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia (see below), and hyperphosphataemia with hypocalcaemia; renal damage and arrhythmias can follow. Early identification of patients at risk, and initiation of prophylaxis or therapy for tumour lysis syndrome, is essential.; monitor for\r\narterial or venous thromboembolism and\r\nuse caution with concomitant drugs that increase the risk of peripheral\r\nneuropathy or thromboembolism\u2014see also Thromboembolism,\r\nbelowThromboembolism\u00a0Risk factors for thromboembolism\r\n(such as smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) should be minimised.Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for at least the first 5 months\r\nof treatment, especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk\r\nfactors.
