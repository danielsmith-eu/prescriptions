[{"indications": "Indications\u00a0\n(From 13.5.3 Drugs affecting the immune response: British National Formulary)\nEtanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab inhibit the activity of tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1). They are used for severe plaque psoriasis either refractory to at least 2 standard systemic treatments and photochemotherapy, or when standard treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications; while either etanercept or adalimumab is considered to be the first choice in stable disease, infliximab or adalimumab may be useful when rapid disease control is required. Ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukins 12 and 23) can be used for severe plaque psoriasis that has not responded to at least 2 standard systemic treatments and photochemotherapy, or when these treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications (see also NICE guidance below). Adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab are also licensed for psoriatic arthritis (section 10.1.3).NICE guidance(1)Adalimumab for plaque psoriasis in adults (June 2008)Adalimumab is recommended for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis which has failed to respond to standard systemic treatments (including ciclosporin and methotrexate) and photochemotherapy, or when standard treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications. Adalimumab should be withdrawn if the response is not adequate after 16 weeks.NICE guidance(2)Etanercept and efalizumab for plaque psoriasis in adults (July 2006)Etanercept is recommended for severe plaque psoriasis which has failed to respond to standard systemic treatments (including ciclosporin and methotrexate) and to photochemotherapy, or when standard treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications. Etanercept should be withdrawn if the response is not adequate after 12 weeks.Following suspension of the marketing authorisation for efalizumab, NICE has temporarily withdrawn its guidance on the use of efalizumab for plaque psoriasis.NICE guidanceInfliximab for plaque psoriasis in adults (January 2008)Infliximab is recommended for the treatment of very severe plaque psoriasis which has failed to respond to standard systemic treatments (including ciclosporin and methotrexate) or to photochemotherapy, or when standard treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications. Infliximab should be withdrawn if the response is not adequate after 10 weeks.NICE GuidanceUstekinumab for plaque psoriasis in adults (September 2009)Ustekinumab is recommended for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis which has failed to respond to standard systemic treatments (including ciclosporin and methotrexate) and to photochemotherapy, or when standard treatments cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications. Ustekinumab should be withdrawn if the response is not adequate after 16 weeks.For patients weighing over 100\u00a0kg, the manufacturer should provide the 90-mg dose of ustekinumab at the same price as the 45-mg dose; Crohn\u2019s\r\ndisease (%s\n(From ADALIMUMAB: British National Formulary)\nADALIMUMAB); ankylosing spondylitis, polyarticular\r\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis\r\n(%s\n(From ADALIMUMAB: British National Formulary)\nADALIMUMAB)", "name": "ADALIMUMAB - PREPARATIONS FOR ECZEMA AND PSORIASIS", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "13 Skin", "13.5 Preparations for eczema and psoriasis", "13.5.3 Drugs affecting the immune response", "Cytokine modulators", "ADALIMUMAB"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0section 10.1.3", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0section 10.1.3", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/201659.htm", "doses": ["By subcutaneous injection, plaque psoriasis, adult over 18 years, initially 80\u00a0mg, then 40\u00a0mg\r\non alternate weeks starting 1 week after initial dose; discontinue\r\ntreatment if no response within 16 weeks"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0section 10.1.3"}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0see under Cytokine Modulators above; Crohn\u2019s disease\r\n(section 1.5.3); psoriasis (section 13.5.3)", "name": "ADALIMUMAB - DRUGS THAT SUPPRESS THE RHEUMATIC DISEASE PROCESS", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "10 Musculoskeletal and joint diseases", "10.1 Drugs used in rheumatic diseases and gout", "10.1.3 Drugs that suppress the rheumatic disease process", "Cytokine modulators"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0predisposition to infection; monitor for infection before, during, and for 5 months after treatment (see also Tuberculosis below); do not initiate until\r\nactive infections are controlled; discontinue\r\nif new serious infection develops; hepatitis\r\nB virus\u2014monitor for active infection; children should\r\nbe brought up to date with current immunisation schedule (section 14.1) before initiating therapy; mild\r\nheart failure (discontinue if symptoms develop or worsen\u2014avoid in\r\nmoderate or severe heart failure); demyelinating CNS disorders (risk of exacerbation); history or development of malignancy; monitor for non-melanoma skin cancer before and during treatment,\r\nespecially in patients with a history of PUVA treatment for psoriasis\r\nor extensive immunosuppressant therapy; interactions: Appendix 1 (adalimumab)Tuberculosis\u00a0Patients should be evaluated\r\nfor tuberculosis before treatment.
