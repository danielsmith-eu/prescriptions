Full blood counts including differential white cell and platelet counts should be monitored. Treatment should be withdrawn in patients who develop signs of pulmonary infiltration. There have been reports of pulmonary infiltrates leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome\u2014patients with a history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors should be used with caution in patients with sickle-cell disease. Spleen size should be monitored during treatment because there is a risk of splenomegaly and rupture.; also\r\nregular morphological and cytogenetic bone-marrow examinations recommended\r\nin severe congenital neutropenia (possible risk of myelodysplastic\r\nsyndromes or leukaemia); secondary acute myeloid leukaemia; osteoporotic bone disease (monitor bone\r\ndensity if given for more than 6 months); interactions: Appendix 1 (filgrastim)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 9.1.6 Drugs used in neutropenia: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Side-effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors include gastro-intestinal disturbances, anorexia, headache, asthenia, fever, musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, rash, alopecia, injection-site reactions, thrombocytopenia, and leucocytosis.
