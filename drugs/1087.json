Exposure to excessive sunlight should be avoided (discontinue if photosensitivity occurs). Quinolones can prolong the QT interval. Moxifloxacin is contra-indicated in patients with risk factors for QT interval prolongation (e.g. electrolyte disturbances, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, bradycardia, congenital long QT syndrome, concomitant use with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval, history of symptomatic arrhythmias) and the other quinolones should be used with caution in these patients. The CSM has warned that quinolones may induce convulsions in patients with or without a history of convulsions; taking NSAIDs at the same time may also induce them. Other interactions: Appendix 1 (quinolones).Use in children\u00a0Quinolones cause arthropathy in the weight-bearing joints of immature animals and are therefore generally not recommended in children and growing adolescents. However, the significance of this effect in humans is uncertain and in some specific circumstances short-term use of either ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid may be justified in children. For further details see BNF for Children.Tendon damageTendon damage (including rupture) has been reported rarely in patients receiving quinolones. Tendon rupture may occur within 48 hours of starting treatment; cases have also been reported several months after stopping a quinolone. Healthcare professionals are reminded that:quinolones are contra-indicated in patients with a history of tendon disorders related to quinolone use;patients over 60 years of age are more prone to tendon damage;the risk of tendon damage is increased by the concomitant use of corticosteroids;if tendinitis is suspected, the quinolone should be discontinued immediately.Contra-indications\u00a0quinolone hypersensitivity.

Less frequent side-effects include anorexia, sleep disturbances, asthenia, confusion, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, tremor, blood disorders (including eosinophilia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia), arthralgia, myalgia, disturbances in vision and taste. Other side-effects reported rarely or very rarely include hepatic dysfunction (including jaundice and hepatitis), hypotension, vasculitis, dyspnoea (more frequent with moxifloxacin), convulsions, psychoses, paraesthesia, renal failure, interstitial nephritis, tendon inflammation and damage (see also Tendon Damage above), photosensitivity, disturbances in hearing and smell.
