Full blood counts including differential white cell and platelet counts should be monitored. Treatment should be withdrawn in patients who develop signs of pulmonary infiltration. There have been reports of pulmonary infiltrates leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome\u2014patients with a history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors should be used with caution in patients with sickle-cell disease.
