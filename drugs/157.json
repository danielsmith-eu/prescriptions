Caution may be required in epilepsy. Children and the elderly are more susceptible to side-effects. Many antihistamines should be avoided in acute porphyria but some are thought to be safe, see section 9.8.2.

Drowsiness may diminish after a few days of treatment and is considerably less of a problem with the newer antihistamines (see also notes above). Side-effects that are more common with the older antihistamines include headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastro-intestinal disturbances.Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/3092.htm", "doses": ["Pruritus, initially 25\u00a0mg at night increased if necessary\r\nto 25\u00a0mg 3\u20134 times daily; child 1\u20136\r\nyears initially 5\u201315\u00a0mg at night increased if necessary to 50\u00a0mg daily\r\nin 3\u20134 divided doses; 6\u201312 years initially 15\u201325\u00a0mg at night increased\r\nif necessary to 50\u2013100\u00a0mg daily in 3\u20134 divided doses; child under 1 year see BNF for Children"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0toxicity in animal studies with\r\nhigh doses; see also notes above"}]
