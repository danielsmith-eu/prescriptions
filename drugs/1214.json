It is recommended that full blood\r\ncounts are monitored weekly. Close monitoring is recommended in patients\r\nwho:receive treatment for more than 10\u201314 days; have pre-existing myelosuppression;are receiving drugs that may have adverse effects on haemoglobin,\r\nblood counts, or platelet function; have severe renal impairment.If significant myelosuppression occurs, treatment\r\nshould be stopped unless it is considered essential, in which case\r\nintensive monitoring of blood counts and appropriate management should\r\nbe implemented.CHM advice (optic neuropathy)Severe optic neuropathy may occur rarely, particularly if linezolid is used for longer than 28 days. The CHM recommends\r\nthat:patients should be warned to report symptoms\r\nof visual impairment (including blurred vision, visual field defect,\r\nchanges in visual acuity and colour vision) immediately;patients experiencing new visual symptoms\r\n(regardless of treatment duration) should be evaluated promptly, and\r\nreferred to an ophthalmologist if necessary;visual function should be monitored regularly\r\nif treatment is required for longer than 28 days.Monoamine oxidase inhibition\u00a0Linezolid is a reversible,\r\nnon-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Patients should avoid consuming large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such\r\nas mature cheese, yeast extracts, undistilled alcoholic beverages,\r\nand fermented soya bean products). In addition, linezolid\r\nshould not be given with another MAOI or within 2 weeks of stopping\r\nanother MAOI. Unless close observation and\r\nblood-pressure monitoring is possible, avoid in those receiving SSRIs, 5HT1 agonists (\u2018triptans\u2019), tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetics,\r\ndopaminergics, buspirone, pethidine and possibly other opioid analgesics.\r\nFor other interactions see Appendix 1 (MAOIs) ", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0diarrhoea (antibiotic-associated colitis reported),\r\nnausea, vomiting, taste disturbances, headache; less commonly thirst, dry mouth, glossitis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration,\r\nabdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastritis, constipation, pancreatitis,\r\nhypertension, fever, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, hypoaesthesia,\r\nparaesthesia, tinnitus, polyuria, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia,\r\nelectrolyte disturbances, blurred vision, rash, pruritus, diaphoresis,\r\ninjection-site reactions; rarely tachycardia, transient\r\nischaemic attacks, renal failure; also reported tooth discoloration,\r\nconvulsions, lactic acidosis, hyponatraemia, pancytopenia,\r\nanaemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis; peripheral\r\nand optic neuropathy reported on prolonged therapy (see also CHM advice\r\nabove)", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/106110.htm", "doses": ["By mouth, 600\u00a0mg every 12 hours usually\r\nfor 10\u201314 days (max. duration of treatment 28 days); child [unlicensed] 1 week\u201312 years, 10\u00a0mg/kg every\r\n8 hours; 12\u201318 years, adult dose", "By intravenous infusion over 30\u2013120\r\nminutes, 600\u00a0mg every 12 hours; child [unlicensed] 1 week\u201312 years, 10\u00a0mg/kg every 8 hours; 12\u201318 years,\r\nadult dose"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0manufacturer advises use only if potential benefit\r\noutweighs risk\u2014no information available"}]
