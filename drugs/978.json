Apomorphine should be initiated in a specialist clinic with at least two days pretreatment with domperidone for nausea and vomiting. After an overnight withdrawal of oral antiparkinsonian medication to induce an \u2018off\u2019 episode, the threshold dose of apomorphine is determined. Oral antiparkinsonian medication is then restarted. The patient must be taught to self-administer apomorphine by subcutaneous injection into the lower abdomen or outer thigh at the first sign of an \u2018off\u2019 episode. Once treatment has been established it may be possible to gradually reduce other antiparkinsonian medications and reduce or withdraw domperidone therapy.
