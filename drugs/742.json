They should also be used with caution in peripheral vascular disease or generalised atherosclerosis owing to risk of clinically silent renovascular disease; for use in pre-existing renovascular disease, see Renal Effects above. The risk of agranulocytosis is possibly increased in collagen vascular disease (blood counts recommended). ACE inhibitors should be used with care in patients with severe or symptomatic aortic stenosis (risk of hypotension) and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. They should also be used with care (or avoided) in those with a history of idiopathic or hereditary angioedema. If jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes occur during treatment then the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued\u2014risk of hepatic necrosis (see also Hepatic impairment, below). Interactions: Appendix 1 (ACE inhibitors).Anaphylactoid reactions\u00a0To prevent anaphylactoid reactions, ACE inhibitors should be avoided during dialysis with high-flux polyacrylonitrile membranes and during low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulphate; they should also be withheld before desensitisation with wasp or bee venom.Concomitant diuretics\u00a0ACE inhibitors can cause a very rapid fall in blood pressure in volume-depleted patients; treatment should therefore be initiated with very low doses. If the dose of diuretic is greater than 80\u00a0mg furosemide or equivalent, the ACE inhibitor should be initiated under close supervision and in some patients the diuretic dose may need to be reduced or the diuretic discontinued at least 24\u00a0hours beforehand (may not be possible in heart failure\u2014risk of pulmonary oedema). If high-dose diuretic therapy cannot be stopped, close observation is recommended after administration of the first dose of ACE inhibitor, for at least 2 hours or until the blood pressure has stabilised.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0see notes above; also less commonly dry mouth, decreased appetite, aphthous stomatitis, angina, tachycardia,\r\npalpitation, flushing, dyspnoea, impotence, excessive sweating; rarely glossitis, bronchitis, interstitial lung disease,\r\ngynaecomastia, peripheral neuropathy, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic\r\nepidermal necrolysis", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/2584.htm", "doses": ["Hypertension, initially 1\u00a0mg once daily (reduced to 500\u00a0micrograms\r\ndaily if used in addition to diuretic (see notes above),\r\nor in cardiac decompensation, in severe hypertension, in volume depletion,\r\nin the elderly, or in renal impairment), then adjusted according to\r\nresponse; usual maintenance dose 2.5\u20135\u00a0mg once daily; max. 5\u00a0mg daily", "Heart failure (adjunct), initially 500\u00a0micrograms once daily\r\nunder close medical supervision (see notes above),\r\nincreased at weekly intervals to 1\u20132.5\u00a0mg once daily if tolerated;\r\nmax. 5\u00a0mg once daily"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0\n(From 2.5.5.1 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: British National Formulary)\nPregnancy\u00a0ACE inhibitors should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential.
