Antipsychotic drugs should also be used with caution in Parkinson\u2019s disease (may be exacerbated by antipsychotics), epilepsy (and conditions predisposing to seizures), depression, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, or a susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma. Caution is also required in severe respiratory disease and in patients with a history of jaundice or who have blood dyscrasias (perform blood counts if unexplained infection or fever develops). As photosensitisation may occur with higher dosages, patients should avoid direct sunlight. Patients with schizophrenia should have physical health monitoring (including cardiovascular disease risk assessment) at least once per year. Interactions: Appendix 1 (antipsychotics). Contra-indications\u00a0Antipsychotic drugs may be contra-indicated in comatose states, CNS depression, and phaeochromocytoma. ; also subarachnoid\r\nhaemorrhage; metabolic disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesaemia; thyrotoxicosis; arteriosclerosis; dose\r\nadjustment may be necessary if smoking started or stopped during treatment", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 4.2.1 Antipsychotic drugs: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Side-effects caused by antipsychotic drugs are common and contribute significantly to non-adherence to therapy.Extrapyramidal symptoms occur most frequently with the piperazine phenothiazines (fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine), the butyrophenones (benperidol and haloperidol), and the first-generation depot preparations. They are easy to recognise but cannot be predicted accurately because they depend on the dose, the type of drug, and on individual susceptibility.Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of:parkinsonian symptoms (including tremor), which may occur more commonly in adults or the elderly and may appear gradually;dystonia (abnormal face and body movements) and dyskinesia, which occur more commonly in children or young adults and appear after only a few doses;akathisia (restlessness), which characteristically occurs after large initial doses and may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated;tardive dyskinesia (rhythmic, involuntary movements of tongue, face, and jaw), which usually develops on long-term therapy or with high dosage, but it may develop on short-term treatment with low doses\u2014short-lived tardive dyskinesia may occur after withdrawal of the drug.Parkinsonian symptoms remit if the drug is withdrawn and may be suppressed by the administration of antimuscarinic drugs (section 4.9.2). However, routine administration of such drugs is not justified because not all patients are affected and they may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia.Tardive dyskinesia is the most serious manifestation of extrapyramidal symptoms; it is of particular concern because it may be irreversible on withdrawing therapy and treatment is usually ineffective. However, some manufacturers suggest that drug withdrawal at the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia (fine vermicular movements of the tongue) may halt its full development. Tardive dyskinesia occurs fairly frequently, especially in the elderly, and treatment must be carefully and regularly reviewed.Most antipsychotic drugs, both first- and second-generation, increase prolactin concentration to some extent because dopamine inhibits prolactin release. Aripiprazole reduces prolactin because it is a dopamine-receptor partial agonist. Risperidone, amisulpride, and first-generation antipsychotic drugs are most likely to cause symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia. The clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia include sexual dysfunction, reduced bone mineral density, menstrual disturbances, breast enlargement, and galactorrhoea. Sexual dysfunction is one of the main causes of non-adherence to antipsychotic medication; physical illness, psychiatric illness, and substance misuse are contributing factors. Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is caused by more than one mechanism. Reduced dopamine transmission and hyperprolactinaemia decrease libido; antimuscarinic effects can cause disorders of arousal; and alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists are associated with erection and ejaculation problems in men. Risperidone and haloperidol commonly cause sexual dysfunction. If sexual dysfunction is thought to be antipsychotic-induced, dose reduction or switching medication should be considered. Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with cardiovascular side-effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias (see under Monitoring), and hypotension (see below). QT-interval prolongation is a particular concern with pimozide (see ECG monitoring in pimozide monograph) and haloperidol. There is also a higher probability of QT-interval prolongation in patients using any intravenous antipsychotic drug, or any antipsychotic drug or combination of antipsychotic drugs with doses exceeding the recommended maximum. Cases of sudden death have occurred.Hyperglycaemia and sometimes diabetes can occur with antipsychotic drugs, particularly clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. All antipsychotic drugs may cause weight gain, but the risk and extent varies. Clozapine and olanzapine commonly cause weight gain.Hypotension and interference with temperature regulation are dose-related side-effects that are liable to cause dangerous falls and hypothermia or hyperthermia in the elderly. Clozapine, chlorpromazine, and quetiapine can cause postural hypotension (especially during initial dose titration) which may be associated with syncope or reflex tachycardia in some patients.Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperthermia, fluctuating level of consciousness, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, sweating, and urinary incontinence) is a rare but potentially fatal side-effect of all antipsychotic drugs. Discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug is essential because there is no proven effective treatment, but bromocriptine and dantrolene have been used. The syndrome, which usually lasts for 5\u20137 days after drug discontinuation, may be unduly prolonged if depot preparations have been used.Hypersalivation associated with clozapine therapy can be treated with hyoscine hydrobromide [unlicensed indication], provided that the patient is not at particular risk from the additive antimuscarinic side-effects of hyoscine and clozapine.Other side-effects include: drowsiness; apathy; agitation, excitement and insomnia; convulsions; dizziness; headache; confusion; gastro-intestinal disturbances; nasal congestion; antimuscarinic symptoms (such as dry mouth, constipation, difficulty with micturition, and blurred vision; very rarely, precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma); venous thromboembolism; blood dyscrasias (such as agranulocytosis and leucopenia), photosensitisation, contact sensitisation and rashes, and jaundice (including cholestatic); corneal and lens opacities, and purplish pigmentation of the skin, cornea, conjunctiva, and retina.Overdosage: for poisoning with phenothiazines and related compounds and atypical antipsychotic drugs, see Emergency Treatment of Poisoning., but less\r\nsedating and fewer antimuscarinic or hypotensive symptoms; pigmentation\r\nand photosensitivity reactions rare; depression; weight loss; less commonly dyspnoea, oedema; rarely bronchospasm,\r\nhypoglycaemia, and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; hypertension,\r\nsweating, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis\r\nalso reported", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/3224.htm", "doses": ["Schizophrenia and other psychoses, mania, short-term\r\nadjunctive management of psychomotor agitation, excitement, and violent\r\nor dangerously impulsive behaviour, adult and child over 12 years, by\r\nmouth, initially 0.5\u20133\u00a0mg 2\u20133 times daily or 3\u20135\u00a0mg 2\u20133 times daily in severely affected or resistant patients;\r\nin resistant schizophrenia up to 30\u00a0mg daily may be needed; adjusted\r\naccording to response to lowest effective maintenance dose (as low\r\nas 5\u201310\u00a0mg daily); elderly (or debilitated)\r\ninitially half adult dose", "By intramuscular or by\r\nintravenous injection, adult over 18 years, initially 2\u201310\u00a0mg, then every 4\u20138 hours according\r\nto response to total max. 18\u00a0mg daily; severely disturbed patients\r\nmay require initial dose of up to 18\u00a0mg; elderly (or debilitated) initially half adult dose", "Agitation and restlessness in the elderly, by mouth, initially 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0mg once or twice daily", "Short-term adjunctive management of severe anxiety, by\r\nmouth, adult over 18 years,\r\n500\u00a0micrograms twice daily", "Motor tics, adjunctive treatment in choreas and Tourette syndrome, by mouth, 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0mg 3 times daily adjusted according to\r\nresponse; 10\u00a0mg daily or more may occasionally be necessary in Tourette\r\nsyndrome; child 5\u201312 years, Tourette\r\nsyndrome, 12.5\u201325\u00a0microgram/kg twice daily, adjusted according to\r\nresponse up to max. 10\u00a0mg daily", "Intractable hiccup, by mouth, adult over 18 years, 1.5\u00a0mg 3 times daily adjusted\r\naccording to response", "Nausea and vomiting, see Prescribing in Palliative\r\nCare", "By intramuscular or intravenous\r\ninjection, 1\u20132\u00a0mg"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0\n(From 4.2.1 Antipsychotic drugs: British National Formulary)\nPregnancy\u00a0Extrapyramidal effects and withdrawal syndrome have been reported occasionally in the neonate when antipsychotic drugs are taken during the third trimester of pregnancy.
