Care is also needed in patients with epilepsy and diabetes.Tricyclic antidepressant drugs have antimuscarinic activity, and therefore caution is needed in patients with prostatic hypertrophy, chronic constipation, increased intra-ocular pressure, urinary retention, or those with a susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma.

The tricyclic-related antidepressant drugs may be associated with a lower risk of cardiotoxicity in overdosage.Central nervous system side-effects are common, particularly in the elderly, and include anxiety, dizziness, agitation, confusion, sleep disturbances, irritability, and paraesthesia; drowsiness is associated with some of the tricyclic antidepressants (see under Choice, below). Convulsions, hallucinations, delusions, mania, and hypomania may occur (see also under Cautions, above), and, rarely, extrapyramidal symptoms including tremor and dysarthria.Antimuscarinic side-effects include dry mouth, blurred vision (very rarely precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma), constipation (rarely leading to paralytic ileus, particularly in the elderly), and urinary retention. Tricyclic-related antidepressant drugs have a lower incidence of antimuscarinic side-effects than older tricyclics.Endocrine effects include breast enlargement, galactorrhoea, and gynaecomastia. Sexual dysfunction may occur. Changes in blood sugar, increased appetite, and weight gain can accompany treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs, but anorexia and weight loss are also seen. Hepatic and haematological reactions may occur and have been particularly associated with mianserin. Another side-effect to which the elderly are particularly susceptible is hyponatraemia (see Hyponatraemia and Antidepressant Therapy, section 4.3). Other class side-effects include nausea, vomiting, taste disturbance, tinnitus, rash, urticaria, pruritus, photosensitivity, alopecia, and sweating.The patient should be encouraged to persist with treatment as some tolerance to these side-effects seems to develop.
