Care is also needed in patients with epilepsy and diabetes.Tricyclic antidepressant drugs have antimuscarinic activity, and therefore caution is needed in patients with prostatic hypertrophy, chronic constipation, increased intra-ocular pressure, urinary retention, or those with a susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma. Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs should be used with caution in patients with a significant risk of suicide, or a history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, because antidepressant therapy may aggravate these conditions; treatment should be stopped if the patient enters a manic phase.Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to many of the side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants; low initial doses should be used, with close monitoring, particularly for psychiatric and cardiac side-effects.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 4.3.1 Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Arrhythmias and heart block occasionally follow the use of tricyclic antidepressants, particularly amitriptyline, and may be a factor in the sudden death of patients with cardiac disease; other cardiovascular side-effects include postural hypotension, tachycardia, and ECG changes. The tricyclic-related antidepressant drugs may be associated with a lower risk of cardiotoxicity in overdosage.Central nervous system side-effects are common, particularly in the elderly, and include anxiety, dizziness, agitation, confusion, sleep disturbances, irritability, and paraesthesia; drowsiness is associated with some of the tricyclic antidepressants (see under Choice, below). Convulsions, hallucinations, delusions, mania, and hypomania may occur (see also under Cautions, above), and, rarely, extrapyramidal symptoms including tremor and dysarthria.Antimuscarinic side-effects include dry mouth, blurred vision (very rarely precipitation of angle-closure glaucoma), constipation (rarely leading to paralytic ileus, particularly in the elderly), and urinary retention. Tricyclic-related antidepressant drugs have a lower incidence of antimuscarinic side-effects than older tricyclics.Endocrine effects include breast enlargement, galactorrhoea, and gynaecomastia. Sexual dysfunction may occur. Changes in blood sugar, increased appetite, and weight gain can accompany treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs, but anorexia and weight loss are also seen. Hepatic and haematological reactions may occur and have been particularly associated with mianserin. Another side-effect to which the elderly are particularly susceptible is hyponatraemia (see Hyponatraemia and Antidepressant Therapy, section 4.3). Other class side-effects include nausea, vomiting, taste disturbance, tinnitus, rash, urticaria, pruritus, photosensitivity, alopecia, and sweating.The patient should be encouraged to persist with treatment as some tolerance to these side-effects seems to develop. They are reduced if low doses are given initially and then gradually increased, but this must be balanced against the need to obtain a full therapeutic effect as soon as possible. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (section 4.2.1) may, very rarely, occur in the course of antidepressant drug treatment.Suicidal behaviour has been linked with antidepressants (see Suicidal Behaviour and Antidepressant Therapy).; also\r\nincreased intra-ocular pressure; high rate of fatality in overdose\u2014\n(From 4.3.1 Tricyclic and related antidepressant drugs: British National Formulary)\nOverdosage\u00a0Limited quantities of tricyclic antidepressants should be prescribed at any one time because their cardiovascular and epileptogenic effects are dangerous in overdosage. In particular, overdosage with dosulepin and amitriptyline is associated with a relatively high rate of fatality. Lofepramine is associated with the lowest risk of fatality in overdosage, in comparison with other tricyclic antidepressant drugs.
