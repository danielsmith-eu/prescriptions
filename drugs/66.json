The use of labetalol in maternal hypertension is not known to be harmful, except possibly in the first trimester. Information on the safety of carvedilol during pregnancy is lacking. If beta-blockers are used close to delivery, infants should be monitored for signs of beta-blockade (and alpha-blockade with labetalol or carvedilol).
