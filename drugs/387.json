Ulipristal, a progesterone receptor modulator, is effective if taken within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected intercourse.Levonorgestrel is less effective than insertion of an intra-uterine device (see below). Ulipristal is as effective as levonorgestrel, but its efficacy compared to an intra-uterine device is not yet known.If vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking levonorgestrel or within 3 hours of taking ulipristal, a replacement dose should be given. If an antiemetic is required domperidone is preferred.; past ectopic pregnancy; severe malabsorption syndromes; active trophoblastic disease (until return to normal of urine- and\r\nplasma-gonadotrophin concentration)\u2014seek specialist advice; interactions:  \n(From Hormonal methods: British National Formulary)\nInteractions\u00a0The effectiveness of levonorgestrel, and possibly ulipristal, is reduced in women taking enzyme-inducing drugs (and possibly for 4 weeks after stopping); a copper intra-uterine device can be offered instead. If the copper intra-uterine device is undesirable or inappropriate, the dose of levonorgestrel should be increased to a total of 3\u00a0mg taken as a single dose [unlicensed dose\u2014advise women accordingly]. There is no need to increase the dose for emergency contraception if the patient is taking antibacterials that are not enzyme inducers. and\r\nAppendix 1 (progestogens)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0menstrual irregularities (see also notes above), nausea,\r\nlow abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness,\r\nvomiting", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/83608.htm", "doses": ["1.5\u00a0mg as a single dose as soon as possible after coitus,\r\npreferably within 12 hours but no later than after 72 hours (but see\r\nalso notes above)"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0not known to be harmful"}]
