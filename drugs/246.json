A reduced dose is recommended in elderly or debilitated patients, in hypothyroidism, and in adrenocortical insufficiency. Repeated use of opioid analgesics is associated with the development of psychological and physical dependence; although this is rarely a problem with therapeutic use, caution is advised if prescribing for patients with a history of drug dependence. Avoid abrupt withdrawal after long-term treatment. Transdermal preparations (fentanyl or buprenorphine patches) are not suitable for acute pain or in those patients whose analgesic requirements are changing rapidly because the long time to steady state prevents rapid titration of the dose.

The most common side-effects include nausea and vomiting (particularly in initial stages), constipation, dry mouth, and biliary spasm; larger doses produce muscle rigidity, hypotension, and respiratory depression (for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression, see section 15.1.7). Other common side-effects of opioid analgesics include bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitation, oedema, postural hypotension, hallucinations, vertigo, euphoria, dysphoria, mood changes, dependence, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, headache, sexual dysfunction, difficulty with micturition, urinary retention, ureteric spasm, miosis, visual disturbances, sweating, flushing, rash, urticaria, and pruritus. Overdosage: see Emergency Treatment of Poisoning.Long-term use of opioid analgesics can cause hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency in both men and women. This is thought to be dose related and can lead to amenorrhoea, reduced libido, infertility, depression, and erectile dysfunction. Long-term use of opioid analgesics has also been associated with a state of abnormal pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia). Pain associated with hyperalgesia is usually distinct from pain associated with disease progression or breakthrough pain, and is often more diffuse and less defined. Treatment of hyperalgesia involves reducing the dose of opioid medication or switching therapy; cases of suspected hyperalgesia should be referred to a specialist pain team.; also\r\nparalytic ileus, peripheral oedema, seizures, asthenia, dyskinesia,\r\nagitation, and tremor", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/63579.htm", "doses": ["See under preparations below", "Name[Palladone\u00ae SR (Napp) ] Capsules, m/r, hydromorphone\r\nhydrochloride 2\u00a0mg (yellow/clear), net price 56-cap pack\r\n= \u00a320.98; 4\u00a0mg (pale blue/clear), 56-cap pack = \u00a328.75; 8\u00a0mg (pink/clear),\r\n56-cap pack = \u00a356.08; 16\u00a0mg (brown/clear), 56-cap pack = \u00a3106.53;\r\n24\u00a0mg (dark blue/clear), 56-cap pack = \u00a3159.82. \r\n    Label:\r\n    2, counselling, see belowDose\u00a04\u00a0mg every 12 hours, increased if necessary according\r\nto severity of pain; child under 12\r\nyears not recommendedCounselling\u00a0Swallow whole or open capsule and\r\nsprinkle contents on soft food"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0\n(From 4.7.2 Opioid analgesics: British National Formulary)\nHepatic impairment\u00a0Opioid analgesics may precipitate coma in patients with hepatic impairment; avoid use or reduce dose.Renal impairment\u00a0The effects of opioid analgesia are increased and prolonged and there is increased cerebral sensitivity when patients with renal impairment are treated with opioid analgesics; avoid use or reduce dose.Pregnancy\u00a0Respiratory depression and withdrawal symptoms can occur in the neonate if opioid analgesics are used during delivery; also gastric stasis and inhalation pneumonia has been reported in the mother if opioid analgesics are used during labour."}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0severe pain in cancer", "name": "HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "4 Central nervous system", "4.7 Analgesics", "4.7.2 Opioid analgesics", "HYDROMORPHONE HYDROCHLORIDE"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0\n(From 4.7.2 Opioid analgesics: British National Formulary)\nCautions\u00a0Opioids should be used with caution in patients with impaired respiratory function (avoid in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma (avoid during an acute attack), hypotension, urethral stenosis, shock, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, obstructive or inflammatory bowel disorders, diseases of the biliary tract, and convulsive disorders.
