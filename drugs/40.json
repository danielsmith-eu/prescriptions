In children avoid prolonged use and use potent or very potent corticosteroids under specialist supervision; extreme caution is required in dermatoses of infancy including nappy rash\u2014treatment should be limited to 5\u20137 days.Psoriasis\u00a0The use of potent or very potent corticosteroids in psoriasis can result in rebound relapse, development of generalised pustular psoriasis, and local and systemic toxicity.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 13.4 Topical corticosteroids: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Mild and moderately potent topical corticosteroids are associated with few side-effects but care is required in the use of potent and very potent corticosteroids. Absorption through the skin can rarely cause adrenal suppression and even Cushing\u2019s syndrome (section 6.3.2), depending on the area of the body being treated and the duration of treatment. Absorption is greatest where the skin is thin or raw, and from intertriginous areas; it is increased by occlusion. Local side-effects include:spread and worsening of untreated infection;thinning of the skin which may be restored over a period after stopping treatment but the original structure may never return;irreversible striae atrophicae and telangiectasia;contact dermatitis;perioral dermatitis;acne, or worsening of acne or rosacea;mild depigmentation which may be reversible;hypertrichosis also reported.In order to minimise the side-effects of a topical corticosteroid, it is important to apply it thinly to affected areas only, no more frequently than twice daily, and to use the least potent formulation which is fully effective.", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/5916.htm", "doses": ["Apply thinly 1\u20132 times daily, reducing strength as condition\r\nresponds"]}]
