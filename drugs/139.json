They should be used for asthma only in patients who regularly use an inhaled corticosteroid (see CHM advice below). They have a role in the long-term control of chronic asthma (see Management of Chronic Asthma table) and they can be useful in nocturnal asthma. Salmeterol should not be used for the relief of an asthma attack; it has a slower onset of action than salbutamol or terbutaline. Formoterol is licensed for short-term symptom relief and for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm; its speed of onset of action is similar to that of salbutamol. Combination inhalers that contain a long-acting beta2 agonist and a corticosteroid (section 3.2) ensure that long-acting beta2 agonists are not used without concomitant corticosteroids, but reduce the flexibility to adjust the dose of each component.", "name": "SALMETEROL", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "3 Respiratory system", "3.1 Bronchodilators", "3.1.1 Adrenoceptor agonists", "3.1.1.1 Selective beta2 agonists"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0\n(From 3.1.1.1 Selective beta2 agonists: British National Formulary)\nCautions\u00a0Beta2 agonists should be used with caution in hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, susceptibility to QT-interval prolongation, and hypertension.

Interactions: Appendix 1 (sympathomimetics, beta2).Hypokalaemia\u00a0Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from beta2 agonist therapy. Particular caution is required in severe asthma, because this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with theophylline and its derivatives, corticosteroids, and diuretics, and by hypoxia. Plasma-potassium concentration should therefore be monitored in severe asthma.", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0\n(From 3.1.1.1 Selective beta2 agonists: British National Formulary)\nSide-effects\u00a0Side-effects of the beta2 agonists include fine tremor (particularly in the hands), nervous tension, headache, muscle cramps, and palpitation. Other side-effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, peripheral vasodilation, myocardial ischaemia, and disturbances of sleep and behaviour. Paradoxical bronchospasm (occasionally severe), urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, and collapse have also been reported.
