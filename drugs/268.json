Interactions are usually caused by hepatic enzyme induction or inhibition; displacement from protein binding sites is not usually a problem. These interactions are highly variable and unpredictable.For interactions of antiepileptic drugs, see Appendix 1; for advice on hormonal contraception and enzyme-inducing drugs, see section 7.3.1 and section 7.3.2.Significant interactions that occur between antiepileptics and that may affect dosing requirements are as follows:Note\u00a0Check under each drug for possible interactions when two or more antiepileptic drugs are usedCarbamazepineoften lowers plasma concentration of clobazam, clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin (but may also raise plasma-phenytoin concentration), tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepinesometimes lowers plasma concentration of eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, primidone (but tendency for corresponding increase in phenobarbital level), retigabine, and rufinamidesometimes raises plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbitalEslicarbazepineoften raises plasma concentration of phenytoinEthosuximidesometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoin Lamotriginesometimes raises plasma concentration of an active metabolite of carbamazepine (but evidence is conflicting)Oxcarbazepine sometimes lowers plasma concentration of carbamazepine (but may raise plasma concentration of an active metabolite of carbamazepine)sometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoin often raises plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbitalPhenobarbital or primidoneoften lowers plasma concentration of clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin (but may also raise plasma-phenytoin concentration), tiagabine, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepinesometimes lowers plasma concentration of ethosuximide, rufinamide, and topiramatePhenytoin often lowers plasma concentration of clonazepam, carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, valproate, zonisamide, and an active metabolite of oxcarbazepineoften raises plasma concentration of phenobarbital and primidone-derived phenobarbitalsometimes lowers plasma concentration of ethosuximide, primidone (by increasing conversion to phenobarbital), retigabine, and rufinamideRufinamidesometimes lowers plasma concentration of carbamazepinesometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoinTopiramate sometimes raises plasma concentration of phenytoinValproatesometimes lowers plasma concentration of an active metabolite of oxcarbazepine often raises plasma concentration of lamotrigine, phenobarbital, primidone-derived phenobarbital, phenytoin (but may also lower), and an active metabolite of carbamazepinesometimes raises plasma concentration of ethosuximide and rufinamideVigabatrin often lowers plasma concentration of phenytoin  in section 4.8.1 and Appendix 1 (phenytoin)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0intravenous injection may cause cardiovascular\r\nand CNS depression (particularly if injection too rapid) with arrhythmias,\r\nhypotension, and cardiovascular collapse;
