[{"indications": "Indications\u00a0\n(From 8.1.2 Anthracyclines and other cytotoxic antibiotics: British National Formulary)\nDoxorubicin is used to treat the acute leukaemias, Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas, paediatric malignancies, and some solid tumours including breast cancer. It is given by injection into a fast-running infusion, commonly at 21-day intervals. Extravasation can cause severe tissue necrosis. Doxorubicin is largely excreted in the bile and an elevated bilirubin concentration is an indication for reducing the dose. Diarrhoea, dehydration, and red coloration of the urine can commonly occur, and renal damage has been reported. Supraventricular tachycardia related to drug administration is an uncommon complication. Higher cumulative doses are associated with cardiomyopathy and it is usual to limit total cumulative doses to 450\u00a0mg/m2 because symptomatic and potentially fatal heart failure is common above this dose. Patients should be assessed before treatment by echocardiography; the elderly, and those with cardiac disease, hypertension, or who have received myocardial irradiation, should be treated cautiously. Cardiac monitoring may assist in determining safe dosage. Caution is necessary with concomitant use of cardiotoxic drugs, or drugs that reduce cardiac contractility. Some evidence suggests that weekly low-dose administration may be less cardiotoxic. Doxorubicin is also given by bladder instillation for the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma, papillary bladder tumours and carcinoma in-situ.  and %s\n(From 7.4.4 Bladder instillations and urological surgery: British National Formulary)\n7.4.4 Bladder instillations and urological surgery", "name": "DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE", "breadcrumbs": ["Home", "BNF No. 63 (March 2012)", "8 Malignant disease and immunosuppression", "8.1 Cytotoxic drugs", "8.1.2 Anthracyclines and other cytotoxic antibiotics", "DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE"], "cautions": "Cautions\u00a0see section 8.1 and notes above; caution in handling\u2014irritant to tissues; interactions: Appendix 1 (doxorubicin)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0see section 8.1 and notes above", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/60614.htm", "doses": ["See Doses"], "pregnancy": "Pregnancy\u00a0avoid (teratogenic and toxic in animal studies); manufacturer of liposomal product advises effective contraception\r\nduring and for at least 6 months after treatment in men or women;\r\nsee also Pregnancy and Reproductive\r\nFunction"}, {"indications": "Indications\u00a0\n(From 8.1.2 Anthracyclines and other cytotoxic antibiotics: British National Formulary)\nDoxorubicin is used to treat the acute leukaemias, Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas, paediatric malignancies, and some solid tumours including breast cancer.
