They are suitable for most antacid purposes. Magnesium-containing antacids tend to be laxative whereas aluminium-containing antacids may be constipating; antacids containing both magnesium and aluminium may reduce these colonic side-effects. Aluminium accumulation does not appear to be a risk if renal function is normal.; interactions: Appendix\u00a01 (antacids)", "side-effects": "Side-effects\u00a0diarrhoea; belching due to liberated carbon dioxide", "fname": "/home/david/src/nhshackday/bnf-html/www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/2027.htm", "doses": ["10\u00a0mL 3 times daily in water"]}]
